Brickfish / NUVI Coding Challenge
Thanks for your interest in working for Brickfish / NUVI. We’re happy to present you with this coding challenge as part of the interview process. Take your time and use whatever resources you need to create your own solution to the problem highlighted below. Zip your code back up and email it back when you’re finished.
Word Search Instructions
You’re going to write a function that can find words in a word search. Here’s how to get it done:

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ to get started if you’re unfamiliar with Node.js
Unzip the attached .zip file and take a look at the .js files included.
Write the missing code in the search.js file.
The search.js file contains one function that you need to write. The function accepts two arguments: 1) a 2d array of letters which represent a word search grid, and 2) an array of words to find within the grid.
You need to write a function that will scan the grid for any of the words in the word list array.
Your matching should be case insensitive.
You need to search in all eight directions (four cardinal directions plus four diagonal)
You should return an array of all the words that can be found in the search
Two example grid files have been provided in the samples/ folder. Two example word lists have also been provided.
To run your code, navigate to the wordSearch folder on the command line and and type node index.js sample/grid.txt sample/words.txt
To run your code against another sample grid and/or wordlist, just change the filenames in the above command
When you’re finished writing your code, zip the folder and email it back. We look forward to hearing from you and reviewing your work!
Notes
Don’t worry about doing any sanitization or writing any tests. We just want to see how you go about solving a problem like this.
If you find yourself editing any files other than search.js you’re probably doing it wrong!
Don’t worry if the problem is too easy or too hard–everyone is on a different level and we just want to see where you’re at.
